### Project Description
The goal of this project is to investigate the relationship between diabetes prevalence and heart disease mortality rates. By leveraging comprehensive health datasets, we aim to provide insights that can inform public health strategies and interventions.

### Data Collection and Preparation
Collected comprehensive health indicator datasets from the CDC website.
Cleaned the data by removing null values and aggregating county-level data to the state level.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Analyzed relationships between variables such as diabetes, obesity, inactivity, and heart disease mortality.
Used bar graphs and scatter plots to visualize correlations and identify trends.

### Model Development
Developed a linear regression model to examine the impact of diabetes on heart disease mortality.
Evaluated model performance with R-squared and p-values to determine statistical significance.

### Key Findings
Identified a strong association between high rates of diabetes and heart disease mortality.
Concluded that reducing diabetes rates could lower the risk of heart disease mortality.

### Recommendations
Suggested targeted interventions for diabetes prevention to reduce heart disease mortality risks.
Highlighted the need for better data and larger datasets to improve model accuracy and prediction efficiency.
